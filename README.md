# API
API created with flask and connected to an SQlite (relational database) DBMS(database management system)

In the file "functionsbd.py" we have the functions of sqlite3 (lib Python) that results in a crud

In the file "main.py", we have the routes of API built with flask and that connects to the database

Thanks for viewing my project!!!
